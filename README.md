## Demo
This is just a demo of how to use OpenAi API.
This demo uses stream, that displays characters as they are generated.
Edit the prompt at prompt.json for custom prompts.
You need an API key from OpenAI, place it in the .env file
Rename .env.example to just .env btw

Run the file with
```bash
yarn start
```
or
```bash
npm run start
```

NOTE: I used nodemon, so the file will re-run after file save, if you do not prefer this use
```bash
yarn runOnce
```
or
```bash
npm run runOnce
```
